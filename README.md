## Project Summary: WGU C964 Capstone - Laptop Price Prediction
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning Regression Model designed to predict laptop prices based on various hardware specifications. It is developed as part of the WGU C964 Computer Science Capstone and runs on My Binder using a Jupyter notebook, allowing users to interact with an intuitive user interface (UI) to estimate laptop prices.

ðŸ›  Key Features

Supervised ML Model: Uses Linear Regression to predict laptop prices.

Feature Engineering: Converts categorical laptop specs (brands, CPU, GPU, OS, etc.) into one-hot encoded features.

Interactive UI: Built with ipywidgets, enabling users to input laptop specifications and get instant predictions.

My Binder Compatibility: Designed to run without installationsâ€”simply open the binder link and start predicting!

Data Visualization: Includes scatter plots to compare actual vs. predicted prices for model evaluation.

ðŸš€ How to Use

Open the My Binder notebook (link provided). Select restart and run all cells. Adjust the laptop specifications using sliders and dropdown menus. Click the "Predict Price" button to generate an estimated price. View results instantly within the notebook!
